        <div id="description">
            <p>What is Dragonball Z? Well, it takes a while to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z" target="_blank">explain</a>, but the very short answer is that Dragonball Z is an anime (Japanese animated series) that (mostly) revolves around the warrior Goku and his friends battling villians in epic fights that literally destroy planets.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Dragonball Z was hugely popular in Japan and became similarly popular in the United States in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The Dragonball universe spawned video games, other series, <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dragonball" target="_blank">a terrible live-action movie</a>, and an enduring fan base.</p>
