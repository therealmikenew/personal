        <h1>Which Dragonball Z character are YOU?</h1>

        <p>What is Dragonball Z? Well, it takes a while to explain, but the very short answer is that Dragonball Z is an anime (Japanese animated series) that (mostly) revolves the warrior Goku and his friends battling villians in epic fights that literally destroy planets.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Dragonball Z was hugely popular in Japan and became similarly popular in the United States in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The Dragonball universe spawned video games, other series, a terrible live-action movie, and an enduring fan base. But to me, I have singular devotion to the specific series Dragonball Z! </p>
        <br>
        <p>With my familiarity with the show, I am (somewhat) capable of determining which Dragonball Z character you are with 3 pointed questions. Amazing, right? Let's get started!</p>
